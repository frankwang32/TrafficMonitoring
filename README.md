## API and Libraries
Basically, MayShow is based on Kickflip SDK and Vitamio SDK. Firebase was included to help us manage the user’s information.

For Kickflip SDK, we implements createNewUser(), loginUser(), startStream(), stopStream(), getStreams(), getStreamsByUser() functions from KickflipApiClient.

For Vitamio SDK, we implements setVideoPath() and setMediaController() from widget.VideoView.

## Test
  * For the first time, click sign up and input any valid username and password. If you've already created a account, just click sign in.
  * You can click Square button to refresh the list.
  * You can search videos of an exist username at the top of the screen in Square.
  * You can click a video to watch, and long click a video to delete.
